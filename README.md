Aim: Predicting whether the given sample of water is safe to use or not.

Generally Water Quality is affected by several factors such as Turbidity, pH value, Chloride levels, Calcium etc.
So continuous monitoring of Water Quality is necessary. Utilized an Ensemble Classifier named Random Forest Classifier to address this issue.

You can collect Datasets from the online Websites which are publicly available.
